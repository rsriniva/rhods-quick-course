= Data Analysis and Visualization

== Objectives

* Become familiar with popular Python libraries for data analysis, transformation, and visualization

== Python libraries for Data Analysis

* Describe the most important NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib primitives and API modules
* A diagram or two with the Python ecosystem libraries would be nice to have here
* Cover the most important API bits only and be brief - use references liberally
* Basics of Matplotlib and Seaborn (check if seaborn is supported in RHODS)
* This lecture covers enough material for the next 3 GEs - use this as a guide when writing the lecture
