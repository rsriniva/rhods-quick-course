== Steps

* Use Case - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud  
* Focus on “Business” use-cases and concepts rather than pure science/pure math use-cases. The social sciences are OK because the data sets and analysis is easy to understand. 
* Avoid too “mathy” use-cases in physics or chemistry that would require prerequisite knowledge.
