= Machine Learning and Deep Learning

== Objectives

* Describe machine learning concepts and create basic models using PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn

== Machine Learning Libraries

* What is ML? Explain all the important terminology - models, training, prediction, validation
* Snapshot of the Python ecosystem for ML and how RHODS supports them
* RHODS partner ecosystem for ML (no need for GE coverage of third parties)
* GPU acceleration in RHODS for ML
* The most popular Python libs for ML - Scikit, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
** Why are they needed? 
** Use-cases they are used for
** API Primitives - most commonly used modules
** Most important algorithms for each library
